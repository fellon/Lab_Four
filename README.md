# Lab_Four
Small game written in C++

Most of the documentation is in the very poor code.

This is an old college project from 04 that was written in C++ Codewarrior. I will be converting / updating it to use MS Visual Studio.
And maybe completing some of the ideas I had just to have closure. That and I really need to get some practice in.
